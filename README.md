# Repository guide #

This repository presents implementations of various algorithms in various programming languages (the [author](https://github.com/VitasSalvantes) mainly uses Java). You can suggest your own options for implementing existing examples (naming them in accordance with the samples) or new options in any programming language.

For quick access to the discription of the program and its implementation you can use the [list of all programs](#List-of-all-programs).

## AmountOfSalaries ##
[Here](AmountOfSalaries.java) you can see how the static method of summing salaries of two workers (instances of the same class) is implemented in Java.

## AtbashCipher ##
[Here](AtbashCipher.java) you can see the implementation of Atbash Cipher in Java.

## ArrayInitialization ##
[Here](ArrayInitialization.java) you can see how array initialization is implemented in the class constructor in Java.

## CaesarCipher ##
[Here](CaesarCipher.java) you can see the implementation of Caesar Cipher in Java.

## ChangingArrayType ##
[Here](ChangingArrayType.java) you can see how a class with two arrays (the first with int values, the second with String values) is implemented in Java. The second array takes all the values of the first array, converts them to String type and stores them in reverse order.

## ConsoleCalc ##
[Here](ConsoleCalc.java) you can see the implementation of a simple calculator in Java. You can enter an unlimited number of numbers and perform various mathemathical operations with them.

## ExchangedValues ##
[Here](ExchangedValues.java) you can see how to exchange values between two variables without using a third in Java.

## Factorial ##
[Here](Factorial.java) you can see the implementation of Factorial in Java and [Here](factorial.py) in Python.

## FibonacciNumbers ##
[Here](FibonacciNumbers.java) you can see the implementation of Fibonacci numbers in Java and [here](FibonacciNumbers.py) in Python.

## FizzBuzz ##
[Here](FizzBuzz.java) you can see the solution to the popular FizzBuzz task in Java. The program should print numbers from 1 to 100. But instead of multiples of three, it prints "Fizz", and instead of numbers that are multiples of five, - "Buzz". Instead of numbers that are multiples of both three and five at the same time, it prints "FizzBuzz".

## PrimeNumbers ##
[Here](PrimeNumbers.java) you can see the implementation of prime numbers in Java.
